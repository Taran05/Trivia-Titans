# Trivia Titans

As a team, we developed a multi-cloud serverless online trivia game that allows users to form teams, compete against other teams in real-time, and track their progress on global and category-specific leaderboards. The game will provide a personalized experience by adapting to users' preferences and offering a diverse mix of questions tailored to their interests and skill levels. Additionally, administrators will have access to analytics tools for monitoring the game's performance and user engagement, enabling them to make data-driven decisions to improve the overall gaming experience.
